Version 0.1.0 (In progress)
* Expanding transport to include S3D models
* Patched to support header only implementation of ANTIOCH	

Version 0.0.6
* More test coverage for newer reaction types
* Better OpenCL detection for OS X
* Better support for VexCL, including commits
  from VexCL author Denis Demidov

Version 0.0.5
* Full support for VexCL
* Additional reaction types supported

Version 0.0.4
https://github.com/libantioch/antioch
* Moving repo to GitHub. Required explicitly adding
  common items since we lose svn:externals.
* Beginning work on supporting VexCL for GPU offload
  capability.

Version 0.0.3
https://svn.ices.utexas.edu/repos/pecos/antioch/tags/0.0.3
* Fixed lingering references to non-existent class member in
  CEAEvaluator.
* Use correct calling sequence in mu_and_k method within
  WilkeEvaluator.
* Improved testing coverage of CEAEvaluator.

Version 0.0.2
https://svn.ices.utexas.edu/repos/pecos/antioch/tags/0.0.2
* Enforce correct header ordering for users of metaprogramming utility
  headers
* Update Avogadro's number and the Universal gas constant to CODATA
  2010 values

Version 0.0.1
https://svn.ices.utexas.edu/repos/pecos/antioch/tags/0.0.1
* Bug fix for incorrect initialization of sum of stoichiometric
  coefficients (Redmine #2898).
* Bug fix for incorrect scaling of equilibrium constant
  (Redmine #2900).

Version 0.0.0
https://svn.ices.utexas.edu/repos/pecos/antioch/tags/0.0.0

* Added core functionality for dealing with gas mixtures:
  - ChemicalSpecies
  - ChemicalMixture
* Added thermodynamics calculations for gas mixtures:
  - CEATheroMixture/CEAEvaluator
  - StatMechThermodynamics
* Added transport computations for gas mixtures:
  - Sutherland and Blottner viscosity models used
    through MixtureViscosity
  - EuckenThermalConductivity
  - ConstantLewisDiffusivity
  - WilkeEvaluator provides interface to viscosity
    and thermal conductivity
* Gas mixture kinetics:
  - ReactionSet/KineticsEvaluator
  - Currently for ArrheniusRate only
  - Currently only for elementary and three boday reactions
* Default ASCII input parsing available for core, thermo, and transport
* XML input parsing for available for ReactionSet.
* Currently 23 unit and regression tests yielding 67.1% line
  coverage and 80.6% function coverage (pass --enable-coverage
  to configure, then run make coverage).
* Supports documentation generation using Doxygen
* Optionally supports Eigen package for vector evaluation of quantities
* Optionally supports the MetaPhysicL library for AD support
