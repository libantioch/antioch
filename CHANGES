Version 0.5.0 (currently in development)

Version 0.4.0
* Antioch no longer header-only
  - The parsing and a few "core" class implementations
    have been move to .C files and their symbols are
    in libantioch. Thus, users must now link against
    libantioch in their applications.
* Added temperature exptrapolation capability to
  KineticsTherory transport models
* Added API to allow resetting kinetics parameters
* Added capability to remove reaction from ReactionSet
* Added (optional) CppUnit-based unit testing
  - Migration of the many existing unit tests to CppUnit
    is still in progress.
* Added partial order support to kinetics
  - Includes support for ChemKin-type specification
    of forward and backward reaction orders
* Several enhancements and bugfixes to XML, ChemKin
  parsing classes
* More testing of AD capabilities with (optional)
  MetaPhsycL library
* Several other smaller bugfixes

Version 0.3.1
* Critical Bugfix for NASA7 Thermo/ChemKin Parser

Version 0.3.0
* Introduced KineticsConditions object.
  - Beginning to encapsulate quantities necessary for
    computing reaction rates.
  - Experimental. Expect future API changes.
* Added NASA7 and NASA9 fits for thermodynamics
  - CEA internally uses NASA9
* Added IdealGasMicroThermo
  - Alternative to StatMechThermodynamics
  - Computes vibrational excitation by subtracting
    translational/rotational from curve fit of total
    quantity
  - MacroThermo is the template parameter for the total.
    Can use, e.g., NASA7, NASA9, etc.
  - Assumes no electronic excitation
* Refactored parsing objects
  - Default ASCII input files provided in share directory
* Added new ChemKin format parsing capabilities
* Complete refactoring of transport models
  - WilkeMixture, WilkeEvaluator now deprecated
  - Replaced by MixtureAveragedTransportMixture,
                MixtureAveragedTransportEvaluator
  - Defined interface for species transport objects
    using CRTP pattern
  - MixtureAveraged* objects templated on species
    transport objects
  - MixtureViscosity, MixtureConductivity, and
    MixtureDiffusion hold species objects for the species
    present in the chemical mixture.
* Added new "KineticsTheory" species models
  - Typically referred to as "Pure Species" model. Based on
    kinetics theory expressions and curve fits of collision
    integrals
  - Antioch must be built with GSL (for splining) in order to
    use KineticsTheory models.
* Several bugfixes in units/parsing corner cases
* This is the last release Antioch will be header-only.
  Subsequent releases will require linking to a built library.

Version 0.2.1
* Critical bugfix for ConstantLewisDiffusivity

Version 0.2.0

* Update in conversion factor for gas constant
* Molar masses are now in mol instead of kmol
* Enabled subdir-objects option in Automake
* Assorted bugfixes

Version 0.1.0
* Photochemistry modeling
* Compatibility with newer VexCL

Version 0.0.8
* Bugfixes when using VexCL
* Better OpenCL, VexCL detection
* Added ANTIOCH_VERSION_AT_LEAST macro (thansk to @RhysU)
* Initial support for automatic differentation
  using MetaPhysicL
* XML parsing support of new reaction types
* Support irreversible reactions
* Use Automake's pkginclude feature (thanks to @RhysU)
* Travis-CI support added (with help from @RhysU and @ddemidov)
* Converted to header only, no library is generated during
  the build now
* Don't distribute the docs in the tarball

Version 0.0.7
* Auto-function optimizations, when compiler is new enough.

Version 0.0.6
* More test coverage for newer reaction types
* Better OpenCL detection for OS X
* Better support for VexCL, including commits
  from VexCL author Denis Demidov

Version 0.0.5
* Full support for VexCL
* Additional reaction types supported

Version 0.0.4
https://github.com/libantioch/antioch
* Moving repo to GitHub. Required explicitly adding
  common items since we lose svn:externals.
* Beginning work on supporting VexCL for GPU offload
  capability.

Version 0.0.3
https://svn.ices.utexas.edu/repos/pecos/antioch/tags/0.0.3
* Fixed lingering references to non-existent class member in
  CEAEvaluator.
* Use correct calling sequence in mu_and_k method within
  WilkeEvaluator.
* Improved testing coverage of CEAEvaluator.

Version 0.0.2
https://svn.ices.utexas.edu/repos/pecos/antioch/tags/0.0.2
* Enforce correct header ordering for users of metaprogramming utility
  headers
* Update Avogadro's number and the Universal gas constant to CODATA
  2010 values

Version 0.0.1
https://svn.ices.utexas.edu/repos/pecos/antioch/tags/0.0.1
