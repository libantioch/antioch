\section bugs Reporting Bugs

Bugs in the code and errors or omissions in the documentation can be
reported to pbauman@ices.utexas.edu.  Requests and contributions are
welcome at the same e-mail address.  All bug reports should include:
<ul>

<li>the version number of Antioch (versioning information can
be obtained by running the <B><code>antioch_version</code></B> binary located in the
bin/ directory of a local Antioch installation),
<li>the hardware and operating system,

/*! \page inputFile Example Antioch Input File

This is an example input file for use with the generic solver
included with Antioch.
Note that Antioch is using 
the <a href="http://getpot.sourceforge.net/">GetPot</a> parsing tool
shipped with <a href="http://libmesh.sourceforge.net">libMesh</a>.  Note
that the default comment delimiter is defined as the \# sign and
comments can begin at the beginning of a line or after a variable
declaration to aid in documenting the input file.  The parsing
mechansism is keyword driven and can be organized into multiple
sections.  Consequently, you are allowed to have variables of the same
name so long as they are within unique section definitions.  Note also
that because the parsing mechanism is keyword driven, the input
directives can be specified in \e arbitrary order.  There is no
requirement to maintain a specific variable declaration pattern.

/*! \page installation Installation/Linkage

Antioch uses the GNU autotools suite (autoconf, automake, and libtool)
for its development build system.  This system is popular among the
Linux development community and provides a familiar build environment
for end users.  

To build Antioch starting from a release distribution, untar the distribution and
enter the top-level directory.

<div class="fragment"><pre class="fragment">
 > tar xvfz antioch-$(VERSION).tar.gz
 > cd antioch-$(VERSION)/            
</pre></div>

<h2>Configuration Requirements</h2>

To date, Antioch has been successfully built and tested with the gcc 4.4, 4.5, and 4.6 compilers
and the Intel 11.1 compilers.

<b>Installation Directory</b>: Use the <tt>--prefix</tt> option to
specify your desired top-level installation directory for Antioch.  The
examples below all configure Antioch to be installed in the user's
~/bin/antioch directory.

<em>Configure with default login environment:</em> <br>

\code > ./configure --prefix=$HOME/bin/antioch \endcode

<em>Or, configure with specific compilers:</em>        <br>

\code > ./configure CXX=g++ --prefix=$HOME/bin/antioch \endcode

<h2> Other Configuration Options </h2>

Antioch can optionally be built with other libraries as well. In particular, Antioch leverages the 
<a href="https://red.ices.utexas.edu/projects/software/wiki/GRVY">GRVY</a> library for
some performance timing capabilities. 

<em>Configure with libGRVY and enable grvy timers :</em> <br>

\code > ./configure --with-grvy=$MY_GRVY_DIR --enable-grvy-timers \endcode

To enable verification using the method of manufactured solutions, Antioch uses
the <a href="https://red.ices.utexas.edu/projects/software/wiki/MASA">MASA</a> 
library. Although Antioch can configure and build with 
<a href="https://red.ices.utexas.edu/projects/software/wiki/MASA">MASA</a>, it is currently not
using these capabilities. This is planned for the next release.

<em>Configure with MASA:</em> <br>

\code > ./configure --with-masa=$MY_MASA_DIR \endcode

Configure help can also be accessed at the command line:

\code> ./configure --help \endcode

<h2> Library Build </h2>

Once configured, issue a <tt>make</tt> to build the software. If successful, this
will build Antioch (static and dynamic libraries and executables).

\code > make \endcode

If you have multiple cores at your disposal, a parallel buid can accelerate
the build time. If there are 4 cores avaiable, then the following will build
using 4 threads, thereby leveraging 4 processors.

\code > make -j 4\endcode

<b> Verifying the build:</b> To verify that the software is working
properly, a test option is provided to run a short suite of
functionality tests against the local build.  To run, issue a <tt>make
check</tt> to run the tests. Note that these tests may take a few minutes
depending upon optimization level and architecture.  
If successfull, output similar to the
following will be generated.

\code
 > make check

\endcode

<h2> Installation </h2>

After the build is complete, issue a <tt>make install</tt> to install
Antioch. This will install the header files, libraries, executables,
and examples.  
The installation will consist of four top-level
directories housing the library, include files, executables, and
example files.  An example of the top-level directories after
installation is shown below:

\code > make install \endcode

Top-level Antioch installation directory:

\code
 > ls $HOME/bin/antioch/
 bin  examples  include  lib
\endcode

<h2>Library Linkage</h2>

To link an external application with the library, the
\c include directory must be added to the compilers include search
path in order to access the necessary header files.  The \c lib directory should also be added
to the linker search path along with a request to link against the
Antioch library.  Several example link steps are provided below.  These
examples assume that the Antioch library has been successfully built and
installed previously in the users's ~/bin/antioch directory:

\code > $(CXX) -I$HOME/bin/antioch/include app.c -L$HOME/bin/antioch/lib -lantioch \endcode

To embed the dynamic library search path for the Antioch library
directly into the application executable, use an additional linker
option as follows:

\code > $(CXX) -I$HOME/bin/antioch/include app.c -L$HOME/bin/antioch/lib \
         -Wl,-rpath,$HOME/bin/antioch/lib -lantioch \endcode
