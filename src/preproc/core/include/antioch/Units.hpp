 * \brief Advanced unit class
 *
 * \class Units
 * \brief An advanced unit class
 *
 * This class contains:
 *   - a std::string for the symbol,
 *   - a std::string for the name,
 *   - a InSI object for the power vector
 *   - a Converter object for the coefficient
 *
 * The idea of this class is to keep track of the unit without
 * performing any operation on the values. To characterize an unit,
 * the unit is projected against the SI basis of units, with the
 * addition of angle unit:
 *
 * (meter,kilogram,second,ampere,kelvin,mol,candela,radian)
 *
 * Thus any unit can be expressed as a linear composition of
 * this std::vector. This is the role of the class InSI to store this
 * linear composition. This linear composition is called the power vector.
 *
 * With the linear composition, comes a coefficient that correspond
 * to the conversion of the considered unit to the SI system. The class
 * Converter takes care of storing it.
 *
 * Thus this class performs a parsing of the symbol of the given unit,
 * compares each unit of the symbol to a set of known units, and construct
 * the linear composition and coefficient by successive additions of
 * the units of the symbol. For instance, the unit m.A/s is seen as
 * \f$\mathrm{m} + \mathrm{A} - \mathrm{s}\f$, and thus the composition 
 * and coefficient are calculated correspondingly:
 *   - adding two units means adding the compositions and multiplying the coefficients
 *   \f[ 
 *         \mathrm{Units}_1 + \mathrm{Units}_2 \Rightarrow 
 *                                           \left\{\begin{array}{l}
 *                                                     \mathrm{InSI}_1 + \mathrm{InSI}_2\\
 *                                                     \mathrm{Converter}_1 \times \mathrm{Converter}_2
 *                                                   \end{array}\right.
 *   \f]
 *   - substracting two units means substracting the compositions and dividing the coefficients
 *   \f[ 
 *         \mathrm{Units}_1 - \mathrm{Units}_2 \Rightarrow 
 *                                           \left\{\begin{array}{l}
 *                                                     \mathrm{InSI}_1 - \mathrm{InSI}_2\\
 *                                                     \frac{\mathrm{Converter}_1}{\mathrm{Converter}_2}
 *                                                   \end{array}\right.
 *   \f]
 *
 * At each unit parsing level, the unit is parsed between a prefixe, a symbol and a power.
 * The symbol "cm-3" will be parsed as a prefixe "c", a symbol "m" and a power "-3". To this
 * parsing, the symbol before the unit is considered. If there is none or it is a dot, nothing
 * to do, but if this is a slash, the power has to be multiplied by -1. Thus
 * the Converter object will have the corresponding SIPrefixes values (Prefixe[6] is this case,
 * which is ("c",1e-2)), and the InSI power vector will add the value "-3" to the corresponding
 * power (0 in this case) if the character before the unit is a dot or does not exist,
 * the value 3 if this character is a slash. The correspondancies between the index in the power vector and
 * the unit is done explicitely.
 *
 * A special treatment is reserved for the kg unit, as it contains a prefixe.
 *
 * This method supports a wide variety of symbol writing, like the use of parenthesises. The
 * used symbol is a fully developped one.
